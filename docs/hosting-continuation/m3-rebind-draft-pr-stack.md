Each branch has a scoped evidence file in this directory. Local verification
for row 15 passed the full uncached Go suite, vet, Docker-tagged compilation,
502 web tests, web production build, and hostd build. Earlier rows record
their exact local checks in their respective evidence files. PR #97's hosted
checks passed at its published head. The Docker request-counter gate in row 14
has only compiled and skipped locally; hosted execution is pending publication.

These branches do not add a production rebind claim writer, migration 034,
successor cutover, transfer-aware readers, recovery or fence release. Migration
033 remains dormant and unreleasable. Publication, merging, deployment, Linux
race, and physical second-device LAN acceptance are separate gates.
